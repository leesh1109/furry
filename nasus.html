            is an imposing, jackal-headed Ascended being from ancient 
            Shurima, a heroic figure regarded as a demigod by the 
            people of the desert. Fiercely intelligent, he was a guardian 
            of knowledge and peerless strategist whose wisdom guided the 
            ancient empire of Shurima to greatness for many centuries. 
            After the fall of the empire, he went into self-imposed exile, 
            becoming little more than a legend. Now that the ancient city 
            of Shurima has risen once more, he has returned, determined to 
            ensure it never falls again.
