            is the storm made manifest. Destructive, wild, and 
            stubbornly resolute, he existed before mortals walked the
            Freljord's tundra, and is fiercely protective of the lands
            that he and his demi-god kin created. Cultivating a deep hatred
            of civilization and the weakness it brought with it,
            he now fights to return to the old ways—when the 
            land was untamed, and blood spilled freely—and eagerly 
            battles all who oppose him, with tooth, claw, and thundering domination.
